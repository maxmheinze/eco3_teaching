## Our Research Question

. . .

What does such an **economic question** look like?

:::{.incremental}
- Suppose the government is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of government-funded **educational leave**.
- How do we as economists and econometricians approach this question?
:::

. . .

We need to think carefully about what specific question we want to investigate.

:::{.incremental}
- In order to test a [**hypothesis**]{.col1} using [**data**]{.col2}, we need both [**data**]{.col2} and a [**hypothesis**]{.col1}.
  - We can derive the hypothesis from a formal **economic model**, for example.
  - We can **collect** data, or we can use data that someone has already collected. This data typically needs to be **processed**.
:::

## Our Model

. . .

We could formulate our question like this:

. . .

If a worker takes advantage of [**educational leave**]{.col1b}, does their [**wage**]{.col2b} increase over the course of their career?

. . .

We assume the following **model**:

$$
\mathrm{Wage} = f\left(\mathrm{Education},\mathrm{Experience},\mathrm{Talent},\mathrm{EducationalLeave},\dots\right)
$$

. . .

Wages depend on our **variable of interest**, the use of educational leave, but also on a number of **other factors**.

. . .

How does the variable education differ from the variable talent?

. . .

- We can easily **observe** how much education a person has, but not how much talent.
- Our outcome (the wage) is therefore influenced by both **observed** and **unobserved** variables.

## Why Do We Do This?

## A Practical Example

. . .

Suppose we are tasked with investigating:

:::{.centering}
[**Does the average class size in a district influence test performance?**]{.col1b}
:::

... and if so, by how much?

. . .

As before, we can assume there are both **observed** and **unobserved** influencing factors.

. . .

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Observed Influencing Factors
:::{.incremental}
- Average household income in the district
- Average reading competence
- Share of students who do not speak the language of instruction at home
- ...
:::
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Unobserved Influencing Factors
:::{.incremental}
- Average student motivation
- Average teacher motivation
- ...
:::
:::
::::

## What a Coincidence, There’s a Dataset for That

. . .

`CASchools` is a dataset on math and reading test scores from 420 California schools in 1999. So let's create **a plot**.

. . .

First, we prepare our data.

```{webr}
# Load packages
library(AER) # Contains our dataset
library(dplyr) # Contains mutate()

# Load data
data("CASchools")

# Compute variables with mutate()
CASchools <- CASchools |>
  mutate(student_teacher_ratio = students / teachers,
         test_score = (read + math)/2)
```

## A Plot

```{webr}
#| fig-height: 4.5
plot(CASchools$student_teacher_ratio, CASchools$test_score,
     xlab="Class Size", ylab="Test Scores")
# abline(lm(test_score~student_teacher_ratio, data = CASchools), col="red")
```

## Interpretation

[What does this plot tell us?]{.fragment data-fragment-id="2"} [**Not much.**]{.col2 .fragment data-fragment-id="2"}

:::{.incremental}
- The data is quite **noisy**.
- If we draw a line through it, it slopes slightly downward.
- What does that tell us?
  - [**Not much.**]{.col2} 🙃
- Are average scores different in districts with class sizes > 22?
:::

. . .

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

```{webr}
CASchools[CASchools$student_teacher_ratio > 22,]$test_score |>
  mean()

CASchools[CASchools$student_teacher_ratio <= 22,]$test_score |>
  mean()
```
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{.incremental}
- In districts with a student-teacher ratio over 22, the average test score is slightly lower.
- What does that tell us?
  - Again, [**not much**.]{.col2}
:::
:::
::::

## Why “not much”? There’s a line, right?

. . .

We face two major problems with this analysis:

:::{.incremental}
- Our estimate comes with **uncertainty**.
  - 383 districts have a student-teacher ratio of ≤ 22, only 37 have > 22.
  - We can be **much more confident** in the mean of the larger subsample than the smaller.
  - Whenever we analyze **samples**, we deal with uncertainty.
- We can't say anything about **causality**.
  - Why are results worse in high-ratio districts?
  - Would they improve if we changed the ratio?
  - Or are the students in those districts different?
  - If they are different, then they likely differ in both observed *and* unobserved characteristics.
:::

## So What Do We Do in Econometrics?

:::{.incremental}
- It’s not enough to simply analyze **economic data** using **statistical methods**.
- We must also think **carefully** about how we analyze and interpret the data.
  - That starts with **data collection**,
  - involves deciding **which methods** we use and **how** we apply them,
  - and includes the **interpretation** of our results.
:::

. . .

:::{.nicebox1}
In **Econometrics I**, **Econometrics II**, and **Applied Econometrics**, we learn step by step how to address these issues. By the end of these three courses, we are able to **independently answer econometric research questions**.
:::

# Causality

## Just Semantics?

<br>

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%" .fragment data-fragment-index="1"}
:::{.nicebox1}
One **additional year of education** [leads to]{.fragment .custom .col2f .quitelargef data-fragment-index="4"} an average **20% increase in wages**.
:::
:::
:::{.column width="50%" .fragment data-fragment-index="2"}
:::{.nicebox2}
People who have **one more year of education** earn on average **20% more**.
:::
:::
::::

:::{.nicebox0 height="150px" .fragment data-fragment-index="3"}
Do these **two statements** mean the **same thing**?  [[**No.** 🙃]{.col2 .quitelarge}]{.fragment data-fragment-index="5"}
:::

## Causal Effects {auto-animate=true}

. . .

As economists, we are often interested in **causal effects**, where [**one variable**]{.col1} affects [**another variable**]{.col2}.

:::{.incremental}
- how does [**price**]{.col1} affect [**demand**]{.col2} for a product?
- how does a particular [**policy measure**]{.col1} affect [**unemployment**]{.col2}?
- how does the use of [**fertilizer**]{.col1} affect [**agricultural yields**]{.col2}?
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note title="Informal Definition: Causality"}
We speak of a **causal effect** when the isolated change of a variable has a **direct, measurable effect** on another variable.
:::

. . .

Let’s take the example of [**fertilizer**]{.col1} and [**agricultural yields**]{.col2}. How could we isolate a **causal effect** here?

## Experiments (1) {auto-animate=true}

Let’s take the example of [**fertilizer**]{.col1} and [**agricultural yields**]{.col2}. How could we isolate a **causal effect** here?

. . .

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
<br>
```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6

set.seed(123)
grid_size <- 10
total_cells <- grid_size * grid_size
red_indices <- sample(1:total_cells, 50)
color_matrix <- matrix("#6b522d", nrow = grid_size, ncol = grid_size)
color_matrix[red_indices] <- "#689acc"

par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NULL, xlim = c(0, grid_size), ylim = c(0, grid_size), xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n',
     xlab = "", ylab = "", asp = 1, bty = "n")

for (i in 1:grid_size) {
  for (j in 1:grid_size) {
    rect(i - 1, j - 1, i, j, col = color_matrix[i, j], border = "black", lwd = 1)
  }
}
```
:::
:::{.column width="60%" .incremental}
- Let’s do an **experiment**!
- We have a square **field** divided into 100 subplots.
- We **randomly** choose 50 plots to fertilize.
- At the end, we measure yields and compare the groups.
:::
::::

## Experiments (2) {auto-animate=true}

Let’s take the example of [**fertilizer**]{.col1} and [**agricultural yields**]{.col2}. How could we isolate a **causal effect** here?

:::{.callout-note title="Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)"}
We assign an intervention to a **randomly selected** study group. A **control group** does not receive the intervention. Such a study approximates a natural science **experiment**.
:::

. . .

Under certain **assumptions**, our results are valid:

:::{.incremental}
- Yields are also influenced by other variables. We assume that the **expectation** of those variables does not differ between groups.
  - That’s why we randomize the groups.
- We also assume that using fertilizer has **no effect on neighboring subplots**.
  - Is that assumption realistic in the setting we thought about?
:::

## Sounds good, let's just do more experiments {auto-animate=true}

. . .

We can’t always run an **experiment** (RCT or lab experiment). There are

:::{.incremental}
- practical reasons,
- financial reasons,
- legal reasons, and
- ethical reasons.
:::

. . .

@coville2020 want to find out if people who haven’t paid their water bills pay faster when their water is shut off.

:::{.incremental}
- They randomly select, among households in Nairobi with payment issues, households where the water is shut off.
- Because customers signed a contract that includes this as a last resort, the authors interpret this as informed consent.
:::

. . .

@cohen2008 examine whether co-payments for malaria nets reduce “wasteful” usage.

:::{.incremental}
- They randomize the price (from 0 to 40 Kenyan shillings) at which malaria nets are distributed to pregnant women.
- They find no evidence that lack of cost leads to wasteful use.

:::{.nicebox1 style="height: 300px;"}
In many cases, conducting an experiment is **unrealistic**. In other cases, it is **ethically questionable**.<br><br>So we often rely on **observational data**.
:::

## Observational Data

. . .

Experiments are becoming more common in economic research, but like other social sciences, we usually work with **observational data**.

:::{.incremental}
- Observational data is **non-experimental**, i.e. not generated through a lab or RCT experiment.
- We can obtain it from many sources: **surveys**, **administrative data**, **satellite data**, ...
:::

. . .

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Advantages
::: {.incremental}
- Often large **scale**, sometimes covering the entire population of a country.
- Reflects **real behavior**.
:::
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Disadvantages
:::{.incremental}
- Not collected **specifically for the study**, so isolating the effect of interest is harder.
- Under certain assumptions and in specific situations, we can still investigate **causal effects**.

# Structure of Econometric Data

## Observations {auto-animate=true}

. . .

Back to our **model** for educational leave:

$$
\mathrm{Wage} = f\left(\mathrm{Education},\mathrm{Experience},\mathrm{Talent},\mathrm{EducationalLeave,\dots}\right)
$$

. . . 

What would a **dataset** look like for studying such a question?

. . .

:::{data-id="tab1" .bitsmall}

: {.striped}
:::

In this dataset, [**columns are variables**]{.col1} and [**rows**]{.col2} are [**observations**]{.col2}.

## Cross-Sectional Data {auto-animate=true}

:::{data-id="tab1" .bitsmall}
| [**Individuals**]{.col2 .bitlarge} | Wage | Education | Experience | Educational Leave |

: {.striped}
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note title="Cross-Sectional Data"}
**Cross-sectional data** consists of a sample of individuals, households, firms, cities, countries, etc., for which data is collected at **one point in time**. We use index $i$ for each observation. The number of observations is denoted $N$.
:::

. . .

- *As a rule*, we assume the sample is **randomly drawn** from a population.

## Time Series Data {auto-animate=true}

:::{data-id="tab1" .bitsmall}
| [**Time Points**]{.col2 .bitlarge} | Wage | Education | Experience | Educational Leave |
|----------------|-----:|-----------:|----------:|---------------:|

| t = 2022              |   0 |         9 |         0 |            No |
| t = 2023              |  12 |        10 |         1 |            No |
| t = 2024              |  14 |        10 |         2 |           Yes |
| t = 2025              |  ... |        ... |       ... |           ... |
: {.striped}
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note title="Time Series Data"}
**Time series data** consists of a sequence of time points at which data is collected on the **same individual** or unit. We use index $t$ for each observation. The number of observations is denoted $T$.
:::

. . .

- We cannot assume a random sample here. Later observations **depend on earlier ones**.

## Panel Data {auto-animate=true}

:::{data-id="tab1" .bitsmall}
| [**Individuals**]{.col2 .bitlarge} | [**Time Points**]{.col2 .bitlarge} | Wage | Education | Experience | Educational Leave |
|-----------|----------------|-----:|-----------:|----------:|---------------:|
| i = 1  | t = 2023              |   20 |         14 |         1 |            No |
| i = 2  | t = 2023              |   12 |         10 |         1 |            No |

: {.striped}
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note title="Panel Data"}
**Panel data** includes both a cross-sectional and time component. Each observation is indexed by $i$ and $t$. We observe $N$ units over $T$ periods, for a total of $NT$ observations.
:::

. . .

- A major advantage of panel data is that we can account for certain kinds of unobserved variation.
